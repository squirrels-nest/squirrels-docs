# Credentials

There are three commands used to access and govern credentials:
1. set-credential
2. get-all-credentials
3. delete-credential


The user can use the `squirrels set-credential [--values VALUES VALUES]key`command to set the keys, replacing the values as needed. 

On the other hand, `get-all-credentials` and `delete-credential` will return all the credentials and delete them respectively.

TODO, Ask Tim how this actually works
