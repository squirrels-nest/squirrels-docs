### Why the name "squirrels"?

"Squirrels" stands for "**S**tructured **QU**ery **I**nterface with **R**ealtime **R**endering and **E**laborate **L**anguage **S**ynchronization". The current "languages" include SQL and Python.

It's also called "squirrels" for the following reasons:

1. "SQURL" was also considered as a name for the framework, which is short for "SQL URL". This sounds like "squirrel"

2. Following the theme of using animal names (plural form) for useful Python packages (like "pandas")
