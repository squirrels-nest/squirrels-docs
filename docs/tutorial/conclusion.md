# What's Next?

A Squirrels project may also contain multiple datasets, or datasets with multiple database views, but that's outside the scope of this tutorial. For an expanded version of the "seattle weather example" project, see this git repo here:

<https://github.com/squirrels-nest/weather-analytics-api-example>

It serves as an example of how to share common Python code or SQL across multiple datasets while allowing their parameter or query definitions to differ. You can also see this page for how to "[Design for Commonality and Variability]".

In addition, see the topic guide for [Versioning Best Practices](../topics/versioning.md) for understanding when to increment the major and minor version for your squirrels project. If you're working with dates, check out the topic guide for [Modifying Dates Using Squirrels](../topics/modify-dates.md).

A user guide for the available classes/methods in squirrels library is not yet available, but hopefully, navigating them in an IDE shouldn't be too difficult as docstrings are provided for all public methods. Given this, you should be all ready to create your own project!
