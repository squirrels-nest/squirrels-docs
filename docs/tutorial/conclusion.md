# Final Thoughts

A Squirrels project may also contain multiple datasets, or datasets with multiple database views, but that's outside the scope of this tutorial. For an expanded version of the "seattle weather example" project, see this git repo [here](https://github.com/squirrels-nest/weather-analytics-api-example). It serves as an example of how to share common Python code or SQL across multiple datasets while allowing their parameters or query definitions to not be identical. You can also see this page for how to "[Design for Commonality and Variability]".
